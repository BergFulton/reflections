When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on a public computer, or even in a situation where your computer is password protected. If you get hit by a bus,
others can still access your code by pulling down from GitHub. Or something. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there may be changes to the remote repository that you do not want to use in your code/they can
introduce a bug. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork- separates it from another person's code, but still copies everything much like clone. Useful if you don't have access to the original code. 

Clone- to make a complete copy of the code. Gets complicated if pushing elsewhere remotely, and doesn't give originator credit.

Branch- When you are making changes to code from the master, or want to try to test out code before committing it all the way. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Being able to work on it if you are offline. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using Google Docs or a shared Dropbox could work, and that would lower the technical overhead (no command line), but it would be harder to be granular about changes, and there'd be no supporting branch structure.
